#### GIT 

GIT is a code versioning tool, enabling backup, documentation, and code collaboration tasks.

GIT tracks the contets of folders, known as  *repositories*.
It  tracks changes in files that are *added* to the repository, *committing* changes to these files. 
GIT enables the user specify a message see exactly what changes are made at each *commit*, providing a simple way to documentat whatchanges have been made over time.

GIT is a local tool,  often accessed with the command line (e.g. GIT Bash).

There are also a vareity of programs that interface with GIT, incluing [VS code]() and [RStudio](), 
enabling users to use GUI tools to work with GIT repositorites. 
It is generally best practice to use only a single program to interface with each GIT repository, as programs may interfere with one another. 

GIT from the command line (*GIT Bash*) is the most relibable method of running GIT.

While using GIT does involve some overhead and additional code complexity, the benefits can make the additional work worthwile, especially xwhen creating and maintaining complicated projects with multiple collaborators.

Free website

Note that even the private version of Github is NOT approved for hosting clinical PHI data.

### Privatly hosted GIT servers

Another method of storing code through GIT repositories is by using a private GIT server.
