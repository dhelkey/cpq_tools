### License Discussion

The choice of a license is an important selection when publicly releasing code and documentation.

It is important to note that not explicitly providing a license during release does not avoid this choice. Code uploaded to GitHub without a license explicitly specified has rights the rights by the authors under [United States copright law](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/copyright-policy/copyright-basics).
Specifying a license allows the authors of the code control over how rights are deligated.

There are advantages and disadvantages to different licenses.
It may be desirable to license different components of a project under different licenses.

### Creative-Commons

A family of open-source license, allowing some use of the work while retaining certain rights, depending on the type of license selecte.

Example: 

The [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
 is licensed under
[CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/legalcode),
requiring attribution before content may be used, restricting the content from being used commercially, and restricting the construction of derivative content without permission of the author.

### Unlicense
[Unlicense]()


example:

[youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is a command line tool for downloading videos from [Youtube](youtube.com), released into the public domain using the Unlicense.

This software is released into the [public domain](UNLICENSE) using a variant of the the Unlicense.

#### Stanford Requirments

the [Stanford Office of Technology Licensing](https://otl.stanford.edu/software) provides the following guidance regarding open-source licensing:

```
Original software code falls under the rubric of copyrighted intellectual property.

The office provides three options for licensing code:

1. Software can be put in the public domain, i.e., copyright is not claimed and anyone can use the software for any purpose and without payment
2. Copyrighted software can be licensed (including through an open source license)
 to the academic community with or without payment, and with or without oth0er restrictions
3. Copyrighted software can be licensed (including through an open source license) 
to the commercial community with or without payment, and with or without other restrictions.

Note: "Open source is different from public domain. 
Copyrighted software can be licensed under an open source license.

To be licensable under any kind of license (including an open source license), 
Stanford must have clear copyright ownership to all portions of the software 
i.e., the software must contain code written only by creators who assign copyright to Stanford. 
It is responsibility of Stanford creators to ensure that Stanford has rights to software created at Stanford."
